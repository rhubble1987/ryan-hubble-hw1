# Welcome to my first homework!

## Description  

For this assignment, I was to refactor a marketing website's code to make it more accessible and clean up the code by adding semantic elements to the HTML. Below are some brief explanations for the changes I made.

---
### Accessibility  

To make the website more accessible, I added alt attributes to every image tag. I also tried to make each alt have descriptive enough language but not too wordy. 

---
### Refactoring with Semantic Elements

HTML: I changed all of the divs to semantic elements. For example, for the main content, I used the main element and then changed its children divs to sections.

CSS: After changing all of the divs to the appropriate semantic elements, I condensed many of the CSS selectors based on these new semantic elements.
